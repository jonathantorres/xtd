# cmd
Parser for command line options

## Installing
The easiest way is to copy the `include/cmd.h` file into your project, update the namespace as you see fit and use it.

## Running tests
Use `cmake` to build and run the tests:
```bash
cmake -B build -S .
cd build
cmake --build .
./cmd_tests/cmd_test
```
